## Feature Manager Pattern
The Feature Manager Pattern is a design pattern that helps manage a collection of features or libraries in a larger software project. The pattern is particularly useful in projects that require modular design and easy extensibility, as it allows for new features to be added without having to modify the existing codebase.

## How it works
The basic idea of the Feature Manager Pattern is to have a central point in the codebase that manages all the features. This central point is typically a class or a file that contains a collection of features or libraries, along with any necessary code to manage them.

Each feature is encapsulated in its own module or library, and these modules are added to the Feature Manager as needed. The Feature Manager then provides an interface for accessing the features, allowing the rest of the codebase to use them without having to know the details of each individual feature.

When a new feature needs to be added to the project, a new module can be created and added to the Feature Manager without having to modify any of the existing code. This makes the project much more modular and extensible, allowing for easy maintenance and updates.

## Advantages
The Feature Manager Pattern has several advantages:

Modular design: The pattern promotes a modular design, which makes the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.
Easy extensibility: New features can be added without having to modify the existing code, which makes the project more extensible and flexible.
Encapsulation: Each feature is encapsulated in its own module or library, which makes it easier to reason about and test.
Separation of concerns: The pattern separates the concerns of managing features and using them, which makes the codebase more readable and easier to understand.
# Example
An example of the Feature Manager Pattern can be found in the file feature_manager.c in the QMK Firmware project. This file manages a collection of custom key features, including counter keys, timer keys, and textflow keys.

Each custom key feature is encapsulated in its own module or library, and these modules are added to the Feature Manager as needed. The custom_key_t struct defines a custom key with a keycode and a corresponding action function to be executed when the key is pressed.

The process_custom_keys function is called by process_record_user in keymap.c and processes the custom keys defined in custom_keys[]. If a matching keycode is found, the corresponding action function is executed. If no match is found, the function returns true.

The Feature Manager Pattern makes it easy to add new custom key features to the project without having to modify any of the existing code. To enable a custom key feature, it must be defined in the config.h file. If a feature is not defined, its corresponding code will be excluded from the build.

## Conclusion
The Feature Manager Pattern is a powerful design pattern that promotes modularity and extensibility in software projects. By encapsulating features in their own modules and managing them through a central point, the pattern allows for easy maintenance and updates. The pattern is particularly useful in projects that require modular design and easy extensibility, and is a great tool for keeping code organized and maintainable.
